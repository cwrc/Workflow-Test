This project should include clients (usually REST clients) for various services provided by CWRC.
Currently, there is only one client (Notification client for working with Notification Manager component), but other clients should be added for other services such as clients for adding a new workflow stamp on an object or clients for accessing (even manipulating) permission rights for each object.
